# Contributing

We welcome contributions to the routing library! This document outlines the process for contributing to this project.

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/routing.git
    ```

3. Create a new branch for your feature or fix:

    ```
    git checkout -b fix/<your-fix-name>
    ```

    or for a new feature:

    ```
    git checkout -b feat/<your-feature-name>
    ```

    or for a docs changes:

    ```
    git checkout -b docs/<your-docs-changes-name>
    ```

## Setting up Pre-commit

We use pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality and consistency. To set this up:

1. Install pre-commit:

    ```
    pip install pre-commit
    ```

2. Install the git hooks:

    ```
    pre-commit install
    ```

When you try to commit, these checks will run automatically. If any checks fail, the commit will be prevented and you'll need to fix the issues before committing again.

To run the checks manually:

```bash
pre-commit run --all-files
```

## Contributing to Documentation

We use MkDocs for our documentation. To set up the documentation environment:

1.  Create and activate a virtual environment:

        pip install uv
        uv venv
        source .venv/bin/activate


2.  Install requirements:

    ```
      uv pip sync requirements.txt
    ```

3.  Documentation files are in the `docs/` directory and written in Markdown format.

4.  To preview your changes locally:

    ```
    mkdocs serve
    ```

    Then visit `http://127.0.0.1:8000` in your browser.

5.  Documentation structure:

        docs/
        ├── index.md          # Main documentation page
        ├── file.md           # Documentation page for file
        ├── folder/
        │   ├── index.md      # Documentation page for folder
        │   └── file.md       # Documentation page for file

6.  Follow these documentation guidelines:

    - Use British English
    - Keep paragraphs concise and focused
    - Include code examples where appropriate
    - Add screenshots for UI-related features
    - Update the navigation in `mkdocs.yml` if adding new pages

7.  Check for broken links and formatting issues before submitting
